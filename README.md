# Market-Expansion-Clustering-Tool

I’ve built a general clustering tool to support non-technical Operations Managers in making informed new market expansion decisions by clustering demand with a built in cost model. The purpose of this tool is to allow dynamic market construction through flexible geographical size while identifying optimally dense clusters or “markets” as expansion candidates. It outputs a series of spreadsheets that can be fed into a Kepler interactive map (Keplergl) to facilitate a more intuitive and actionable understanding of latent out-of-territory demand.

The two part video tutorial and accompanying blog post walk users through the use of the tool (Appendix 2). The instructional materials aim to make MECT easy to adopt by the non-technical business operations manager, and thus avoid jargon and excessive formality.
